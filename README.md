# FlappyPig-Game

# Overview

<!-- {Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->

<!-- {Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.} -->
I created a Flappy Bird style game, except mine is with a pig. To play the game, press the space bar to make the pig go up and down. Go through the pipes to earn points. The game automatically closes if you hit a pipe.

<!--{Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->
The purpose of this code is to make a fun game with a fun theme.

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.} -->

# Development Environment

<!-- {Describe the tools that you used to develop the software} -->
I watched a tutorial and looked for advice online to help me debug.

<!-- {Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.} -->
I used PyGame and Python language. I also imported random.

# Future Work

<!-- {Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.} -->
* In the future, I would add a start page and an end page
* I would also add lag to the beginning to start creating pipes after a few seconds
* I could also keep old scores so the player can compare to how they did before
